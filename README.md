# Drowsy Driver Alert System using OpenCV

## Overview

This project is a drowsy driver alert system that utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor a driver's facial features and detect signs of drowsiness or fatigue. 
The system is built using the OpenCV library in Python.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of a driver's eyes using a webcam.
- Facial landmark detection to track eye movements.
- Calculation of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine drowsiness.
- Alert mechanism when drowsiness is detected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
- NumPy

## Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy

Run the script: python drowsy_driver_alert.py
